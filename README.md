## :dart: Problem Statement :

In This project Created a Power BI Dashboard which helps to create a comprehensive sales report and insightful dashboard that provides a clear overview of sales performance, trends, and analysis. 
We have gathered data from various sources, including sales data, product information, geography, sales representatives, and categories. The task involves data gathering, data modeling, DAX calculations, 
and creating visuals for the dashboard.

## Data Gathering / Requirement:
         1. Sales (folder by year)
         2. Categories (Excel)
         3. Geography (Excel)
         4. Product (CSV)
         5. SalesRep (Excel)
         6. SubCategories (Excel)

## Data Gathering and Integration:
We need to create a mechanism to load all the files from the sales folder into a single Sales fact table. The mechanism should be resilient, meaning it should not cause errors when files are removed from the sales folder or when new yearly sales files are added. The fact table should be automatically updated when new data is added.

## Data Modelling:
  ### :black_small_square: Transformations and Data Type Setting:

  ### :black_small_square: Creating Unique Keys:

    
  ### :black_small_square: Cleaning ID Columns:

    
  ### :black_small_square: Data Model Creation:
We will create the data model connecting all tables and utilize the Calendar table that has already been set up.

## Data Analysis Expression (DAX) Calculation :
Measures used in visualization are:



## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Report:
Data visualization for the dataset was done using Microsoft Power BI Desktop:

## :bar_chart: Dashboard:
Using the measures and calculations, we will design a one-page sales dashboard with various visuals, including charts, graphs, and geo maps. The dashboard will represent sales insights and trends, making it easy to comprehend and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
