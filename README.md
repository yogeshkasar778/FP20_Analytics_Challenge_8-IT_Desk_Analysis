## :dart: Problem Statement :

We have gathered data from various sources, including sales data, product information, geography, sales representatives, and categories. The task involves data gathering, data modeling, DAX calculations, 
and creating visuals for the dashboard.

In this challenge, you are presented with a reliable dataset that shows the IT ticket data and Agentsâ€™ profiles for a fictitious company that you work for. 
You will provide your actionable insight into your organization's trends, usage patterns, systems behaviours, service level agreement etc. 
It will help our IT department to stay up to date with industry developments. We have gathered data from various sources, including IT Agents and Tickets. The task involves data gathering, data modeling, DAX calculations, 
and creating visuals for the dashboard.

#### In the Tickets Table

- The client requires the canvas settings of the PBI report to be H:1080 - W:1920
- The client would like columns Severity and Priority to be split into 2 columns, creating an ID and classification columns. Example Severity Key column = 0 and Severity Type = Unclassified.
- The Average Resolution time is 4.5 days. The Client would like to create a new column where if the Resolution time is above 3.5 days = "Outside SLA" and if it is below "Within SLA". This will allow the client to push for all calls to stay within the limit by targeting these calls and agents.
  
#### In the IT Agents Table

 - Column Full Name to be split into 2 columns Name and Last Name, where last name is missing to be obtained from the email address column.
